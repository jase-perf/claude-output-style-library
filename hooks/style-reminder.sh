# style-reminder — a UserPromptSubmit hook that keeps custom output styles enforced.
#
# Claude Code injects a per-turn reminder ("<Name> output style is active.
# Remember to follow the specific guidelines for this style.") ONLY for its
# built-in styles (Proactive, Explanatory, Learning). Custom styles are placed
# in the system prompt once and never reinforced, so their voice fades in long
# sessions. This hook emits the exact same reminder line for whatever custom
# style is active, closing that gap.
#
# Install: install.sh --enforce   (or copy this file and register it under
# hooks.UserPromptSubmit in ~/.claude/settings.json)
